This is yet another modification to the jquery autocomplete plugin.  The goals of this mod are:

1. allow results to have a secondary piece of information inserted into its own div for custom styling
2. add ability to watch multiple inputs and encode the values into ajax requests
3. add ability to append elements onto the list that trigger a function and have a custom style associated with them
