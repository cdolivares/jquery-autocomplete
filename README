This is yet another modification to the jquery autocomplete plugin.  The goals of this mod are:

1. allow results to have a secondary piece of information inserted into its own div for custom styling
2. add ability to watch multiple inputs and encode the values into ajax requests
3. add ability to append elements onto the list that trigger a function and have a custom style associated with them

Added Functionality By Chris Olivares

---------------------------------------

This plugin was modified to work with require.js and interface with a URL endpoint that returns formatted data.

Main Additions:
  1. Callbacks:
    Jquery autocomplete uses synchronous and asynchronous callbacks to signal events. See the script for the lists.

  2. Multi-input watching. Jquery.autocomplete now allows you to do multi-faceted search by adhering to a few naming conventions on the form side.

  3. Multi-faceted search caching with delayed cache expiry

  4. Separation of search inputs to watch and where the results are displayed. Simply pass in the parent to append to as a jQuery selector.

  5. Search overlay shown between result fetching by simply passing in a jQuery selector.  Useful for providing instant feedback to the user when search is executing.
